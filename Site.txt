Plasmium

Premium Ethereum experience, by Plasmmer.
Plasmium will be a Layer3 built atop ZK L2s.

The endgame for scaling, leading to the way of 100K TPS*
* Plasmium, even with it A and B chains, can't achieve that alone; but its Layer3 approach may inspire and open the door to a plethora of new designs for scaling Ethereum beyond its Layer2 TPS limits by using Layer3's.

Sitting in zkSync Era, Plasmium A.
Sitting in Polygon zkEVM, Plasmium B.

One day, these A & B chains should appear as one in a wallet, and validated as one using a single validator.
